<p>Imagine a requester who has been offering a series of different HITs.
<br>
Workers who participated in them reported the bonuses that they got.</p>
<p>We will show you the reported bonus sums, one by one, and ask you to determine the average bonus for that requester.</p>
<p>We will then give you information about the requester’s future plans, and ask you to predict the bonus that this requester would would pay on next HIT.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Let’s begin with a practice trial.</p>
