  <p>Thank you for taking part in our study!
    <p>
<br>In this study we will ask you to help us evaluate people’s average level of physical activity.
<br>To do this, we had volunteers wear a fitness watch, which kept track of the number of minutes they engaged in aerobic physical activity (walking, jogging, dancing, intense house work) on a particular day. 

  <!--<p>Let’s begin with a short practice</p>-->
