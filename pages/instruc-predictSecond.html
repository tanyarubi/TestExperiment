  <p>We will now move to a different group of requesters.</p>
    <p>To clearly distinguish it from the previous group, the bonuses will now appear in different color.<br>
    Your task will be slightly different, too. </p>
    <p>Now, you will not only estimate the average bonus, but also learn additional information and predict a future bonus.</p>

<p>After estimating the average bonus, we will then give you information about the requester’s future plans, and ask you to predict the bonus that this requester would would pay on next HIT.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Let’s begin with a practice trial.</p>
